          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS is defined as a Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS gives the content style.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
            <li>The inline styles are applied to the specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule tos tyle a apecific element only.</li>
            <li>The internal styles are applied to a specific page, and can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements within the page code.</li>
            <li>The external styles are the preferred method (in most cases) because they allow to keep all CSS rules in a separate file and make the design changes easier.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or the attribute to which the rules apply.</li>
            <li>A declaration contains 2 components: the CSS property that needs to be applied and the value of that property (for example: color(property):blue(value)).</li>
            <li>Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma, which helps to write DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) code.</li>
            <li> text-align is one of the ways to center the a title or a heading on a webpage.</li>
            <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
            <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
            <li>Based on learned concepts, the following items were created: margin and padding for the webpage, the style for the header and footer (width, height, background color and color of the text),
              alignment for the headers h1 and h2, style for the previously added image (display, height, width, margin-left and margin-right), style for the lists (padding and font size), style for the text within the boxes (text-align and font size), and 
              style for the .card elements (width, margin, border and box-shadow).
