          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS is defined as a Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS gives the content style.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
            <li>The inline styles are applied to the specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule tos tyle a apecific element only.</li>
            <li>The internal styles are applied to a specific page, and can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements within the page code.</li>
            <li>The external styles are the preferred method (in most cases) because they allow to keep all CSS rules in a separate file and make the design changes easier.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or the attribute to which the rules apply.</li>
            <li>A declaration contains 2 components: the CSS property that needs to be applied and the value of that property (for example: color(property):blue(value)).</li>
            <li>Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma, which helps to write DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) code.</li>
            <li> text-align is one of the ways to center the a title or a heading on a webpage.</li>
            <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
            <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
            <li>Based on learned concepts, the following items were created: margin and padding for the webpage, the style for the header and footer (width, height, background color and color of the text),
              alignment for the headers h1 and h2, style for the previously added image (display, height, width, margin-left and margin-right), style for the lists (padding and font size), style for the text within the boxes (text-align and font size), and 
              style for the .card elements (width, margin, border and box-shadow).

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that adds interactivity to a website.</li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>An asiggment operator "=" assigns tha specific data that is stored in the variable.</li>
            <li>The variable contains a string that includes that includes a value.</li>
            <li>The console.log method is used to output a message to the webconsole and used to test the interactivity of the website.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Typically, JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows to interrupt control flow.</li>
            <li>A for loop is used to iterate over the array so that the block of code can be iterated over, or repeated, one for each item in the array.</li>
            <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
            <li>A function is a reusable block of code that contains instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
            <li>To declare a function, a function keyword is used and then given a unique name followed by parentheses. It is followed by the curly brackets that contain the code for the task to be performed.</li>
            <li>Once function is declared, it can be called to produce the expected output. In the example used, functions were listTopics() and selectTopics().</li>
            <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
            <li>In addition to writting a functional script using JavaScript, a consept of the debugging was introduced. The debugigng process allows to identify the issues within the code by constantly checking the code in the Live Environment to ensure that the desired output in produced.</li>
            <li>Once the bug is identified, the process is established to determine how to fix it.</li>        
            <li>To navigate to Chrome DevTools console: right click on the page, select Inspect, and then select Console.</li>
